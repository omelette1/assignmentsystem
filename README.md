## AI-Powered Course Assignment Project
___
### Teacher: Ryan
### Team:
- **Owen Chen**
- Emily Wang
- Brandon P

### Summary:
- A course assignment system that enhances the learning process by automating assignments, grading, and providing personalized feedback through AI enhancements. When a student submits an assignment this would use computer vision to analyze the things on paper, then provide AI created solutions/feedback to the user/teacher. This will give individual students more feedback without having to ask the teacher, while also giving the teacher more time to focus on other tasks. 

### Requirements:
- Student profiles
- Assignment Generation
- Grading System
- Feedback system
- Analytics
- Notifications and Alerts - Calendar system?
- Admin Page - Permission based security

### Technologies:
- Backend - Flask or Node.js
	- Machine Learning Libraries: Scikit-learn, tensorFlow, or Pytorch for AI tasks
	- Database: MySQL to store data
- Frontend
	- React
	- HTML/CSS - tailwind?
- AI:
	- Assignment generation: Natural Language Processing (NLP)
	- Grading: Computer vision or NLP to Analyze and grade responses
	- Feedback/recommendations: Collaborative filtering/supervised learning. 

### Concerns?
- Should students get similar assignments if in same class so they can collaborate?
- Are we looking at doing assignments on the computer?
